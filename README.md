# IDMWorks IGA Total Cost of Ownership Calculator

A web-based calculator designed to help organizations quantify the true expenses associated with Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) programs.

## Overview

This single-page application goes beyond software licensing to measure the hidden costs of identity management, including the people, processes, and time required to manage identities, access, and compliance.

## What It Calculates

The calculator provides a comprehensive view of IGA program costs by analyzing:

- **People costs**: Staffing requirements and time spent
- **Process costs**: Operational workflows and procedures
- **Time investments**: Hours required per transaction
- **Volume impacts**: Scale of identity management operations

Results are presented as monthly, annual, 3-year, and 5-year projections to help organizations understand both immediate and long-term costs.

## How It Works

1. **Select Use Cases**: Choose from relevant identity governance scenarios:
   - Onboarding (Joiners)
   - Offboarding (Leavers)
   - Role changes (Movers)
   - Access requests and approvals
   - Data quality management
   - Compliance and governance activities

2. **Answer Questions**: Provide information about:
   - Transaction volumes
   - Staff count involved
   - Time spent per transaction
   - Hourly rates

3. **Review Results**: Get comprehensive cost breakdowns using the standard formula:
   ```
   Monthly Cost = Volume × Staff Count × Hourly Rate × Hours per Transaction
   ```

## Key Features

- **Multiple Use Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of joiner/mover/leaver processes, data quality, access management, and governance
- **Customizable Configuration**: Add or edit use cases and questions to match your organization's needs
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports and share configurations
- **Two Operating Modes**:
  - **Calculate Mode**: Perform cost assessments
  - **Configure Mode**: Customize use cases and questions
- **Local Data Storage**: Preserves user inputs and custom configurations between sessions

## Purpose
